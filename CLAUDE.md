Testnet4 Reorg Calculator (Rust)
This project provides a Rust program to calculate the proof-of-work (PoW) difficulty and hashrate required to reorganize the Bitcoin Testnet4 blockchain from a specified block height. The tool accounts for Testnet4's 20-minute minimum difficulty rule and estimates the time and hashrate needed to perform a reorg in a timely manner. It uses the rust-bitcoincore-rpc crate for reliable interaction with a Bitcoin Core Testnet4 node.
Overview
Reorganizing Testnet4 involves creating a new chain with more cumulative work (sum of block difficulties) than the existing chain from a given block height to the current chain tip. This Rust program automates the process of calculating the total work of the existing chain and determining the hashrate required to mine a new chain that overtakes it within a specified time.
Key Concepts
Difficulty: A measure of how hard it is to find a valid block hash, expressed as a multiple of the minimum difficulty (difficulty 1, requiring ~2³² hashes).
Work: The expected number of hashes to find a block, proportional to difficulty. Total chain work is the sum of all block difficulties.
Testnet4's 20-Minute Rule: If a block's timestamp is more than 20 minutes after the previous block, it can be mined at difficulty 1, leading to "block storms" of low-difficulty blocks.
Reorg: To reorg, your new chain must have more work than the existing chain from the fork point to the tip.
Hashrate: The number of hashes per second your mining hardware can compute (e.g., TH/s).
Prerequisites
A Bitcoin Core node running Testnet4 (-testnet4 flag).
Rust (stable, latest version) with Cargo (rustup update).
The rust-bitcoincore-rpc and serde crates for JSON-RPC communication and serialization.
Access to a Testnet4 explorer (e.g., mempool.space/testnet4) for manual verification.
Claude API access for code generation (optional, if using Claude to refine the code).
Setup
Run a Testnet4 Node:
Install Bitcoin Core and start it with:
bitcoind -testnet4 -rpcuser=<user> -rpcpassword=<pass>
Ensure the node is fully synced to the latest Testnet4 block.
Install Rust:
Install Rust via rustup: https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install.
Verify with: cargo --version.
Create a Rust Project:
cargo new testnet4-reorg-calculator
cd testnet4-reorg-calculator
Add Dependencies:
Update Cargo.toml:
[dependencies]
bitcoincore-rpc = { version = "0.18", features = ["json"] }
serde = { version = "1.0", features = ["derive"] }
Configure RPC Access:
Update your bitcoin.conf with:
testnet=4
rpcuser=<your_username>
rpcpassword=<your_password>
rpcport=48332
Restart the node after configuration.
Calculation Steps
Input Parameters:
Fork Height: The block height where the reorg starts.
Current Height: The current chain tip height (queried via RPC).
Target Time: The desired time (in seconds) to complete the reorg.
Hashrate: Your available hashrate (in hashes/second, e.g., 150e12 for 150 TH/s).
Query Existing Chain Work:
Use rust-bitcoincore-rpc to call getblock and retrieve the difficulty of each block from the fork height to the current tip.
Sum the difficulties to calculate the total work.
Estimate New Chain Work:
Query the current network difficulty with getdifficulty.
Calculate the number of blocks needed at the current difficulty to exceed the existing chain's work.
Calculate Hashrate or Time:
If hashrate is provided, compute the time to mine the required blocks.
If time is provided, compute the required hashrate.
Account for Testnet4 Dynamics:
Handle block storms (sequences of difficulty-1 blocks) by checking if a single high-difficulty block can reorg them.
Optionally, account for timestamp manipulation to avoid the 20-minute rule.
Rust Program Plan
The program uses rust-bitcoincore-rpc for JSON-RPC communication with a Testnet4 node, ensuring robust and idiomatic Bitcoin integration. Below is a plan for the Rust program, which you can use with Claude to generate or refine the code.
Claude Prompt
Write a Rust program that calculates the hashrate and time required to reorganize Bitcoin Testnet4 from a given block height. The program should:
1. Use the `rust-bitcoincore-rpc` crate to connect to a Testnet4 node via JSON-RPC.
2. Accept command-line arguments: fork block height, mode (time or hashrate), and value (hashrate in hashes/second or target time in seconds).
3. Query the difficulties of blocks from the fork height to the current chain tip using `getblock` and `getblockhash`.
4. Calculate the total work (sum of difficulties) of the existing chain.
5. Query the current network difficulty using `getdifficulty`.
6. Compute the number of blocks needed to exceed the existing chain's work.
7. If hashrate is provided, calculate the time to mine the blocks. If time is provided, calculate the required hashrate.
8. Handle Testnet4's 20-minute rule by noting if a single high-difficulty block can reorg many low-difficulty blocks.
9. Output the results in a clear format, including blocks needed, time, hashrate, total work, and current difficulty.
Use Rust best practices (e.g., `Result` for error handling, type safety, modular structure), include detailed doc comments, and ensure compatibility with `rust-bitcoincore-rpc` version 0.18.

Below is the updated Rust program using rust-bitcoincore-rpc:
use bitcoincore_rpc::{Auth, Client, RpcApi};
use std::env;
use std::error::Error;

    let (blocks_needed, output_value, total_work, current_difficulty) = result;
    println!("Blocks needed: {:.2}", blocks_needed);
    if mode == "time" {

Changes from Previous Version
Switched to rust-bitcoincore-rpc: Replaced reqwest with rust-bitcoincore-rpc for robust, type-safe RPC communication with Bitcoin Core, aligning with the rust-bitcoin ecosystem.
Updated Dependencies: Modified Cargo.toml to include bitcoincore-rpc version 0.18 with the json feature.
Simplified RPC Logic: Leveraged rust-bitcoincore-rpc’s RpcApi trait for direct get_block_hash, get_block, get_block_count, and get_difficulty calls, reducing boilerplate JSON handling.
Maintained Core Logic: Kept the calculation logic unchanged, ensuring the same functionality for computing blocks needed, time, and hashrate.
Rust Best Practices: Used Result for error handling, added doc comments, and structured the code for clarity and maintainability.
Usage
Save the code in src/main.rs.
Update the RPC URL, username, and password in the connect_to_node function.
Build and run the program:
cargo build
cargo run -- <fork_height> <mode> <value>
<fork_height>: The block height to start the reorg (e.g., 100000).
<mode>: Either time (provide hashrate) or hashrate (provide target time).
<value>: Hashrate (hashes/second, e.g., 150e12 for 150 TH/s) or time (seconds).
Review the output, which includes:
Number of blocks needed.
Time required (if hashrate provided) or hashrate required (if time provided).
Total work of the existing chain.
Current network difficulty.
A note if a single high-difficulty block may suffice.
Example
$ cargo run -- 100000 time 150e12
Blocks needed: 51.00
Time required: 4.06 hours
Existing chain work: 500000050.00
Current difficulty: 10000000.00
Additional Notes
Testnet4’s 20-Minute Rule: The program notes if a single block at the current difficulty can reorg many low-difficulty blocks, common in Testnet4 block storms.
Mining Setup: To perform the reorg, use mining software (e.g., cgminer) connected to your Testnet4 node. Rent hashrate from services like NiceHash if needed.
Community Coordination: Reorgs may affect Testnet4 users, as coins are traded. Coordinate with the community (e.g., via Bitcoin Core PRs or forums).
Future Improvements: Add support for timestamp manipulation and dynamic difficulty adjustments based on Testnet4’s DAA.
Rust-Bitcoin Ecosystem: The rust-bitcoincore-rpc crate is actively maintained by the Rust Bitcoin Community, ensuring compatibility with Bitcoin Core.
